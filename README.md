## Project Overview

The Smart Inventory Management System aims to help users manage inventory with smart features:

1. **Add Items**: Users can add items to the inventory.
2. **Display Items**: Users can view all items in the inventory.
3. **Retrieve Items**: Users can search for specific items by name or category.
4. **Check Freshness**: Users can upload images of fruits, and the system determines whether the fruit is fresh using machine learning.
5. **Predict Price**: The system predicts the price of items based on predefined models.

The frontend of this project is built using **React** for an interactive user interface, and the backend is powered by **Firebase** for data storage.

## Features

1. **Add Items**: Users can easily add new inventory items with details such as name, category, and quantity.
2. **Display Items**: View a complete list of all items available in the inventory.
3. **Retrieve Items**: Search for items by name, category, or any other criteria.
4. **Check Freshness**: Upload images of fruits, and the system uses AI models to predict whether the fruit is fresh or not.
5. **Predict Price**: Predict the price of items based on specific input data or pre-trained models.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Firebase (for real-time database and storage)
- **AI/ML Integration**: Google Teachable Machine or other machine learning models for freshness detection and price prediction.
